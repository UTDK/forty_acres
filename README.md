# Forty Acres Developer Documentation

The Forty Acres theme is intended as a parent theme and as such the files in it should never be edited as this theme will get updated and potentially overwrite any changes you make to it. For theme customizations create a subtheme by using the STARTERKIT. The README.md file in the STARTERKIT has instructions for doing this.
